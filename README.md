# Cashier-App
 - This is the very first simple app I have created using Ruby program.
 
## Overview of the Program
- This program can replace the manpower as this can do exactly the job done by the cashier.

## How this app works
- The program will ask for the quantity of the customer's order based on the available set of menu.
- Once the order is completed, this will compute the total cost of the order.
- This app will also ask if the money of the customer exceeds or the amount given is not enough based on customer's total order cost.
- Lastly, the program will also ask if the customer wants to have the copy of the receipt.
